                | Squirrel is a bank account, controlled by an app, aimed at making managing your money easy. We completely redesigned the onboarding, sign-up and activation process for their app.

              h4 Problem
              p
                | A number of users had downloaded the app which had a convoluted onboarding and setup process. Users were skipping through this onboarding and consequently, on first using the app, didn&apos;t really understand how to use it. The result of this was they never continued using Squirrel.

              h4 Solution
              p
                    | We took the 3 stage process of onboarding, sign-up and activation, merging all three in to one combined linear flow, cutting the number of steps, and vastly shortening the copy by augmenting it with icons and diagrams to reduce cognitive load of a previously text heavy experience. We were also able to gain the user&apos;s trust in using the app and the service by highlighting early on the types of protection their money had by using the familiar logos of the bank that was protecting their money, and the financial standards agency that authorised and regulated Squirrel.
