              h4 Summary
              p
                | ITV Hub is a service for watching live TV, catchup TV and streaming video on demand. Some of the programmes have Audio Described and Signed versions but this content is not easily discoverable. The solution allowed accessible content to be easily grouped together and navigated to.
              br
              h4 Problem
              p
                | Some platforms have limited accessible content (e.g. audio-described or signed content). If there is no clear way of grouping this content then when a user wants to browse for audio described or signed content then they have to sift through a lot of content to find content with accessible versions. This becomes a significant pain point for those wishing to browse accessible content.


              br  
              h4 Solution
              p
                | By using the category page (which groups by genres such as Drama, Documentaries, Sport) and creating additional categories 'Audio Described' and 'Signed - BSL' the user will be able to browse programmes that have Audio Described and Signed versions.

              p
                | AD and BSL icons on the episode tile of each episode as well as on the main programme image would further indicate that this content does indeed have AD and/or BSL versions.

              p
                | When a user opens the content in the video player after navigating from the Audio Described or Signed categories then the player will have the Audio Described or Signed button toggled on by default

              p
                | It's worth noting, the term 'signed' to refer to signed content is common across different VOD services but from feedback from first-language BSL (British Sign Language) users of common VOD platforms the term BSL was more useful to them becasue this calls out that the type of signing is not a simplified sign language such as Makaton. After user testing with BSL in the category menu, a number of Hub users weren't familiar with what BSL meant so the decision was made to go with 'Signed - BSL'. This is understood by all and it also communicates to first-language BSL VOD users that the signed content is of the preferred BSL type.

              p As more BSL and AD content becomes available on a platform this could create another issue. One hypothesis is that someone who wishes to find AD and BSL content may have a need to further refine content by a specific genre. 
              p One possible solution could be to make the experience for users wishing to discover BSL or AD content similar to the experience of any other VOD user. By having the homepage, category pages and search pages only surface accessible content (hiding non AD or BSL content) based on a user setting linked to that user's profile.
              p This whole area would need more research ahead of when the accessible content offering is to significantly increase and is a good example of how content strategy and UX should be planned together.
