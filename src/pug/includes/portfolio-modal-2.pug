              h4 Summary
              p
                | ITV Hub is a service for watching live TV, catchup TV and streaming video on demand. Some of the programmes have Audio Described and Signed versions but this content is not easily discoverable. The solution allowed accessible content to be easily grouped together and navigated to.

              h4 Problem
              p
                | If a user wanted to browse for Audio Described and Signed content they do not know if a programme has those specific versions until they go from the homepage or category page to the programme/episode page. it was apparent this was a significant pain point for those wishing to view accessible content.


                
              h4 Solution
              p
                    | By using the category page (which groups by genres such as Drama, Documentaries, Sport) and creating additional categories 'Audio Described' and 'Signed - BSL' the user will be able to browse programmes that have Audio Described and Signed versions.

              p
                    | AD and/or BSL icons on the episode tile of each episode as well as the main programme image would further indicate that this content does indeed have AD and/or BSL versions.

              p
                    | When a user opens the content in the video player after navigating from the Audio Described or Signed categories then the player will have the Audio Described or Signed button toggled on by default

              p
                    | It's worth noting, the term 'signed' to refer to signed content is common across different VOD services but from feedback from first-language BSL (British Sign Language) users the term BSL was more useful to them. After user testing with BSL in the category menu, a number of Hub users weren't familiar with what BSL meant so the decision was made to go with 'Signed - BSL'. This is understood by all and it also communicates to first-language BSL Hub users that the signed content is BSL rather than a simplified sign language like Makaton.
