                | Firebox are an alternative homeware and lifestyle shopping site. A number of the products they sell are personalised products in which you can upload images to be printed on products such as cushions, facemasks, suitcase covers etc. I completely redesigned the product personalisation process.
              
              h4 Problem
              p
                | Drop-off rates during the product personalisation process were quite high, particularly on mobile. Through user testing the current process, a number of key pain-points were identified.

              h4 Solution
              p
                | After identifying common pain-points and by iterating through designs, wireframes, prototypes and validating with more user testing, all of the pain points identified were systematically addressed and resolved.
