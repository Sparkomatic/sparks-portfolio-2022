              h4 Summary
              p
                | ITV Hub is a service for watching live TV, catchup TV and streaming video on demand. Users can find content by browsing or they can use the search tool for finding specific content. I completely redesigned the Search tool.

              h4 Problem
              p
                | A combination of user interviews, surveys and task-based usability testing of our current search revealed the following.

              ul.list.mb-5
                li
                  | On Browser, no messaging around unsuccessful searches (dead-end results) so the user is unsure if the problem lies at their end.

                li
                  | Search is 'unforgiving' (not intelligent (doesn't handle spelling mistakes)).
                
                li
                  | Sometimes VOD and catchup services will have differences in content availability across different platforms due to rights availability (or rights may have completely expired across all platforms) so clicking on the item would create an error.

                li
                  | A number of users refer to certain shows by their acronyms and when searching by popular acronyms the appropriate show is not returned.
                li
                  | On Smart TVs, due to the lack of fuzzy search and predictive search, a high number of TV remote key presses were required to return some content items.
                li
                  | The 'focus navigation' pattern used by Smart TV creates restrictions such as having to navigate over a row of characters on a keyboard before being able to select one of the search results.
                li
                  | Some of the matches for content were no longer available to watch so would create dead-end journeys.


              h4 Solution
              p
                | Integrated a new search engine that utilises fuzzy search and predictive search as well as matching on synonyms. An availability check is also performed to ensure all searchable content is currently available.

              p Returned results in a grid of thumbnails enabling matches to be surfaced after a few key presses. For Smart TV created a mini keyboard variant that allowed more space to display search results while still maintaining readability. Introduced recent searches links for users that regularly search for the same show.

              h4 Tools and techniques
              p
                | User interviews, user surveys, prototypes plugged into a development version of the new search API, task-based usability tests (Userzoom) both to identify current problems and validate design solutions.

              h4 Case Study
              p Full case study unavailable until the final work has been released. I'm happy to elaborate if there are any specific questions that I can answer without disclosing sensitive information.
