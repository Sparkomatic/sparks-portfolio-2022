              h4 Summary
              p
                | ITV Hub is a service for watching live TV, catchup TV and streaming video on demand. Users can find content by browsing or they can use the search tool for finding specific content. I completely redesigned the Search tool.

              h4 Problem
              p
                | User interviews and task-based user testing of a current search feature is a useful way of understanding some of the current pain points and user needs. The following refers to common issues across a number of VOD platforms.

              ul.list.mb-5
                li
                  | No messaging around unsuccessful searches (dead-end results) can result in a user being unsure if the problem lies at their end.

                li
                  | If the search function is 'unforgiving' (not intelligent (doesn't handle spelling mistakes) either a user fails to notice a mistake in their search string and assumes the content is not available, or they have to go back and make adjustments to correctly spell the search term.
                
                li
                  | Linked to the previous point, On Smart TVs, due to the lack of fuzzy search and predictive search, a high number of TV remote key presses will be required to return some content items.

                li
                  | More so on VOD platforms that offer users catch-up content, some users end up repeatedly searching for the same show to catch up on the latest episode.
                li
                  | VOD platforms returning just images with title treatment without any additional text can lead to problems quickly reading the programme name if the user is not familiar with the artwork.

                li
                  | Sometimes VOD and catchup services will have differences in content availability across different platforms due to rights availability (or rights may have completely expired across all platforms) so clicking on the item would create an error.
                li
                  | A number of users refer to certain shows by their acronyms and when searching by popular acronyms (to save entering long titles) the appropriate show is not returned.

                li
                  | The 'focus navigation' pattern used by Smart TV creates restrictions such as if your results are shown on either side of the search keyboard, a user would have to navigate over a row of characters on the keyboard before being able to select one of the search results items.

              h4 Solution
              p
                | Introducing a search engine such as that utilises fuzzy search will usually handle spelling mistakes and predictive matching out of the box. Most of these solutions also support synonyms which allows content managers to add acronyms and pseudonyms to each show, therefore, allowing users to search by these alternative names. 

              p By introducing an availability check in the backend search solution you ensure all searchable content returned is currently available avoiding errors when the user selects any of the search results.

              p For the purpose of searching for content on Smart TVs you can utilise a text input keyboard variant that is reduced in the number of keys and size to the standard keyboard that is used for password entry. This is because there is no need for upper and lower case differentiators or special characters. By reducing the keyboard size it allows more space to surface either more search results or larger search results images.

              p Introducing a list of recent searches links makes it easier for users that regularly search for the same show to find that show without typing in the search string.

              p If all the programme images returned in search contain only title art then duplicating the programme title in a text field beneath the image can increase the speed at which the search results can be scanned.

              h4 Tools and techniques
              p
                | User interviews, user surveys, prototypes plugged into a development version of the new search API, task-based usability tests (Userzoom) both to identify current problems and validate design solutions.

              h4 Case Study
              p Full case study unavailable until the final work has been released. I'm happy to elaborate if there are any specific questions that I can answer without disclosing sensitive information.
